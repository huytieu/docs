## Quality for the age of vibe coding

AI pair programmers make it effortless to ship features at warp speed—but quality often gets left behind. Scout explores your app like the people who will actually use it: curious newcomers, power users, and even mischievous bad actors. It flags usability friction, functional gaps, and risky flows before they reach production.

> Give Scout a URL at [scoutqa.ai](https://scoutqa.ai) and it returns focused feedback instead of noise, so you can keep moving fast without gambling on product quality.
