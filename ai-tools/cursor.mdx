Cursor helps you and your AI pair ship code fast. Scout keeps that velocity from turning into production risk. Use this guide to weave Scout into your Cursor sessions.

## Before you crank out changes

- Open the branch or sandbox you're experimenting with inside Cursor.
- Launch a quick Scout exploration against staging so you have a baseline report.
- Add context to the mission: mention the feature, branch, or problem you're about to tackle.

## During the session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prototype with Cursor">
    Let Cursor generate the updates you need. Keep an eye on its diff viewer for risky changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share findings with Scout">
    Drop the latest branch preview URL into your active Scout mission. The persona will retest the exact flow you're touching.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Loop the feedback back">
    Paste relevant Scout findings into Cursor's chat so the AI has concrete issues to fix.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After you merge

- Run a short "Launch smoke" mission in production to ensure the vibe still feels right.
- Tag the findings that matter with the branch name so future regressions are easy to spot.
- Convert lingering issues into automation candidates as the feature solidifies.

<Note>
  Working in a team? Create a shared Scout mission template for Cursor-driven experiments so everyone collects the same high-quality intel.
