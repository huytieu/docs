Claude Code is great at refactoring and generating new flows. Scout validates the experience those changes create. Here's a lightweight workflow.

## Set the ground rules

<ResponseField name="Project brief" type="markdown" required>
Summarize the feature Claude is helping with and link to the Scout mission that will verify it.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Quality checklist" type="list">
List the user journeys Claude must preserveâ€”Claude can reference it when producing code.
</ResponseField>

## Work the loop

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ask Claude confidently" icon="comments">
    Feed Claude the latest Scout findings so it understands what broke and what "better" looks like.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Launch an exploration" icon="rocket">
    Each significant Claude change should trigger a quick Scout run against staging or a branch preview.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review together" icon="people-arrows">
    Walk through Scout's report with Claude. Ask it to suggest code fixes or tests that address the issues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lock in learnings" icon="bookmark">
    Update Claude's project brief with resolved findings so the next iteration doesn't reopen them.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Tips

- Use Claude's `plan` mode to outline a refactor, then verify each milestone with a targeted Scout mission.
- When Scout flags UX friction, ask Claude for copy or layout tweaks and re-run the mission.
- Store the best prompts and mission templates in your repo so teammates can reuse them.
