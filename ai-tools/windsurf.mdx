Windsurf's canvas view is perfect for juggling multiple files and ideas. Pair it with Scout so every experiment gets vetted before it ships.

## Create a shared canvas

- Add a panel for your current Scout mission, including persona notes and critical paths.
- Pin open tabs for affected code files alongside the latest Scout findings.
- Use comments in Windsurf to assign fixes stemming from Scout's report.

## Run explorations without leaving flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stage a preview">
    Use Windsurf's integrated terminals to spin up your app locally or deploy a branch preview.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Scout">
    Send the preview link to Scout. Choose a timebox that matches the scope of your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply feedback">
    As Scout findings arrive, keep them visible in your canvas and check them off as you address each issue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Collaborate in real time

- Invite teammates into the same Windsurf canvas so everyone sees the code and the quality feedback simultaneously.
- Use Scout's mentions to notify collaborators when you need validation or pairing on a tricky bug.
- When you're done, export the canvas and attach it to the completed Scout mission for future reference.

<Note>
  Running long-lived canvases? Schedule nightly Scout runs against the linked environment so the shared context always reflects current quality.
