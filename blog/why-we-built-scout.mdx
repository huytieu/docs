## Quality for the age of vibe coding

Generative pair programmers, instant hosting, and collaborative sandboxes let anyone ship software at breakneck speed. Replit, Lovable, Bolt.new, Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Kiro, Amazon Q—the list grows weekly. We call this wave vibe coding: builders exploring ideas through rapid iteration and AI assistance.

Speed is intoxicating, but it leaves quality exposed. Most vibe coders are not QA specialists, and traditional automation suites were never designed for hour-to-hour experimentation. The result is a flood of unverified experiences hitting staging and sometimes production.

## The moment the gap appeared

On our own projects we felt the pain immediately. Features materialized in minutes, yet nobody had the time—or frankly the patience—to craft end-to-end tests. Manual QA teams could not keep pace with the torrent of experiments. We were shipping faster than we were learning whether the work actually held up.

## Meet Scout: a quality companion

Scout was born to explore applications the way real people do. Instead of asking teams to write scripts, Scout drops into your app as different personas: a first-time visitor, a power user racing through flows, or an adversarial actor looking for trouble. It reports what it finds so you can respond before your users do.

- **Explores unconventional paths** that human testers rarely have time to cover.
- **Spotlights UI and UX friction** that breaks the vibe of a new feature.
- **Catches functional regressions** hiding inside AI-generated code.

Scout is not a gatekeeper—it is an early warning system keeping pace with your creativity.

## From today to tomorrow

Today, Scout gives you a fast feedback loop. Send a URL, set intent, and you get a field report with reproduction steps, screenshots, and impact notes. You stay in flow, but you no longer fly blind.

> The intel you gather now seeds the automation you need later. Every finding is a breadcrumb toward a reusable safeguard.

Our roadmap is already unfolding:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Scout CLI" icon="terminal" href="/tooling/cli">
    Automate explorations from your terminal or CI. Coming soon.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scout MCP" icon="sparkles" href="/tooling/mcp">
    Connect Scout to your agent ecosystem via the Model Context Protocol. Coming soon.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Send a Scout first

The old QA model expected a final gate keeper. In the era of vibe coding you need an autonomous scout that runs ahead, discovers hazards, and shares the intel in language the whole team understands. That is why we built Scout.
