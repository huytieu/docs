<Note>
  The Scout CLI is under active development. This page outlines the planned experience so you can prepare your workflows.
</Note>

## Planned capabilities

- Launch missions from local terminals or CI pipelines with `scout run`.
- Upload persona briefs and mission templates stored in your repo.
- Stream live mission progress and findings directly in your shell.
- Export reports as JSON or Markdown for custom reporting.

## Example workflow

```bash
# Authenticate once per machine
scout login

# Launch a mission against staging using the onboarding template
scout run --template onboarding --env staging --timebox 7

# Stream findings and open the report when complete
scout report mission_123 --open
```

## Integrations

- **CI/CD** – Use the CLI inside GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or any runner to gate deployments.
- **Local dev** – Pair the CLI with hot module reloading so vibe coding sessions always end with a quality check.
- **Task runners** – Wrap common commands in npm/yarn scripts or Makefiles (e.g., `make scout-smoke`).

## Timeline

We are targeting an early access release later this year. Want in? Email [support@scoutqa.ai](mailto:support@scoutqa.ai) with details about your workflow.
