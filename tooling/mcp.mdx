<Note>
  MCP support is planned after the CLI launch. We want to make it easy for your AI agents to collaborate with Scout.
</Note>

## Use cases we want to enable

- Give your AI agent the power to launch and monitor Scout missions autonomously.
- Feed mission findings back into agent context so remediation tasks stay grounded in real bugs.
- Allow agents to schedule recurring quality checks when they detect risky code changes.

## Proposed resources

<ResponseField name="missions.launch" type="procedure" required>
Agents request a new mission by providing persona, environment, and objectives.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="missions.status" type="query">
Poll or subscribe for mission lifecycle events.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="findings.list" type="query">
Retrieve structured findings to feed into downstream workflows or chains of thought.
</ResponseField>

## How to contribute feedback

- Share the agents or workflows you plan to connect.
- Tell us which resources should be read-only or write-enabled.
- Vote on the order you'd like to see features ship (launching missions vs. reading findings, etc.).

Write to [support@scoutqa.ai](mailto:support@scoutqa.ai) with "MCP" in the subject line and we'll reach out when the private beta opens.
