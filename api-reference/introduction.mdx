## Authentication

Scout's API will use OAuth2 with workspace-level scopes. You'll generate client credentials inside the app and authorize integrations by role.

## Webhooks

Expect webhooks for exploration lifecycle events (`started`, `completed`, `failed`) and high-severity findings. Configure delivery to Slack, Teams, or custom endpoints.

## Beta access

We are onboarding early partners. If you want to shape the API, email [support@scoutqa.ai](mailto:support@scoutqa.ai) with your use case.
