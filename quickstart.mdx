## Get up and running fast

Scout is built for the new era of vibe coding—fast, iterative, and collaborative. Follow these steps to invite Scout into your workflow.

### Step 1: Create your workspace

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Sign up or log in">
    Visit [scoutqa.ai](https://scoutqa.ai) and create a workspace for your team. You can start with a personal workspace and add collaborators later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Share access details securely">
    Provide the URL you want Scout to explore. For gated experiences, upload read-only credentials or session details—nothing is stored after the run.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Shape the mission

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Pick a persona">
    Decide who Scout should emulate: a first-time visitor, a power user racing through flows, or a risk-seeking adversary.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="bullseye" title="Set goals and guardrails">
    Outline the outcomes you care about (onboarding success, checkout stability, etc.) and note any areas Scout should avoid.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Launch and review

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send the Scout">
    Start the exploration. Most sessions complete in a few minutes, depending on app complexity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read the field report">
    Findings arrive in your workspace with reproduction steps, screenshots, and severity notes. Respond, assign, or schedule a follow-up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate confidently">
    Re-run Scout whenever you ship new changes or experiment with AI-generated code. You keep the momentum, Scout keeps the quality.
  </Step>
</Steps>
