Scout starts with guided explorations and grows into an automation platform that runs quality checks for you.

## Today: Explorations on demand

- Launch manual runs during vibe coding sessions or before demos.
- Schedule recurring explorations on the flows that define your user experience.
- Share generated reports with design, growth, or support teammates to keep everyone aligned.

## Tomorrow: Self-maintaining safeguards

## Working toward automation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Capture context">
    Tag findings you want to automate with labels such as `Regression candidate` or `Critical path`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Standardize data">
    Add structured metadata (environment, user role, prerequisites). The richer the data, the easier it is to automate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pilot automations">
    Ask the Scout team for access to early automation features once you have a handful of repeatable flows.
  </Step>
</Steps>
