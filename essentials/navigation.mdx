The Scout you send determines the quality of the intel you receive. Personas and scopes work together to emulate real situations and uncover issues traditional automation rarely touches.

## Personas

<CodeGroup>
```text First-time visitor
Ideal for onboarding flows. Scout prioritizes discoverability, broken entry points, and confusing copy.
```
```text Power user
Moves fast, chains shortcuts, and stress-tests high-value flows like checkout or data exports.
```
```text Adversarial actor
Looks for misconfigurations, exposed admin access, and actions that could corrupt data.
```
</CodeGroup>

Tune each persona with:

- **Voice & tone** – Describe how the persona thinks (“cautious newcomer”, “impatient hacker”).
- **Goals** – Outline must-complete tasks or success criteria.
- **Forbidden paths** – Anything the persona should avoid, like deleting production data.

## Scopes

Scopes define the playground for an exploration.

<ResponseField name="Environment" type="url" required>
Provide the URL or deep link where the persona should begin.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Entry point" type="string">
Tell Scout whether to start authenticated, as a guest, or by completing a setup action first.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Timebox" type="duration">
How long the persona should explore before handing back the report.
</ResponseField>

## Mission templates

Reuse combinations of personas and scopes to maintain consistency:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Launch smoke" icon="rocket">
    5-minute runs in production to validate sign-up, settings, and sign-out flows on every deploy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Checkout deep dive" icon="cart-shopping">
    Adversarial persona on staging pushing discount logic, refunds, and failed payments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Growth experiment" icon="chart-line">
    Power user persona verifying AI-generated features before you roll them to beta users.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security sweep" icon="shield-halved">
    Adversarial persona exploring admin surfaces and permission boundaries after major refactors.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Tips for crisp intel

- Share screenshots or Looms when launching a new scope so Scout learns intent faster.
- Keep mission templates short—multiple focused runs beat one overloaded brief.
- Revisit persona notes monthly as your product, user base, and risk tolerance evolve.
