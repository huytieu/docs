Scout provides the signal—your team's habits turn that signal into outcomes. Borrow these playbook patterns to keep quality visible without slowing shipping.

## Daily rituals

- **Explorer standup** – Review overnight findings in five minutes. Decide which ones need fixes now versus after the current sprint.
- **Pair with AI** – Feed Scout's findings back into your coding assistant so regenerated code reflects what broke.
- **Run after merge** – Trigger a short exploration whenever a major branch lands in main.

## Weekly cadences

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quality sync" icon="people-group">
    Walk through the week's highest-severity findings and follow up on previous action items.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Template audit" icon="folder-open">
    Retire personas or scopes that no longer match your risk profile and create new ones for upcoming releases.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scorecard review" icon="medal">
    Celebrate avoided incidents, track resolution times, and surface processes that need refining.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Release checkpoints

- **Launch rehearsal** – Run an adversarial exploration on staging 24 hours before launch.
- **Post-release sweep** – Send a first-time visitor persona through production after the feature is live.
- **Debrief** – Use Scout's timeline to reconstruct any incidents and feed lessons into your templates.
