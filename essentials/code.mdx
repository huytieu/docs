Scout is most powerful when findings turn into real product improvements. This page walks through the tools built into each report to help you move from triage to resolution.

## Prioritize the right work

<ResponseField name="Severity" type="enum" required>
`Critical`, `Major`, `Minor`, or `Note`. Severity is assigned automatically but you can adjust it as you learn more.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Confidence" type="percentage">
Scout highlights how confident it is in the finding. Low confidence findings are perfect candidates for a quick re-run before you invest time.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="User impact" type="string">
Short narrative describing who experiences the issue and how it affects them.
</ResponseField>

## Chop down time-to-fix

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Link to work management" icon="link">
    Create issues in Jira, Linear, or GitHub directly from the report so context stays intact.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Attach evidence" icon="paperclip">
    Drag in logs, Loom videos, or design updates to capture decisions alongside the finding.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask for retest" icon="repeat">
    Trigger a focused follow-up exploration after a fix is merged.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create checklist" icon="list-check">
    Capture manual steps for release sign-off while automated coverage is still being built.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Stay in sync with AI-generated code

Vibe coding means code changes constantly. Use Scout as your feedback loop:

1. Launch an exploration after each major AI-assisted change set.
2. Review findings and tag them with the feature branch name.
3. Share the report with your pairing AI so it has grounded feedback when iterating.

## Measuring progress

- Track resolution time by persona to spot gaps in ownership.
- Export findings monthly to understand categories that need better automation.
- Celebrate the number of critical issues caught before productionâ€”Scout keeps score so you can champion quality.
