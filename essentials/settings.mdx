Scout workspaces bring every exploration, persona, and insight together. Use this guide to understand the levers that keep your quality loop organized.

## Workspace basics

<ResponseField name="Name" type="string" required>
Choose a recognizable name for your workspace. Teams running multiple products often mirror the product name here.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Logo" type="image">
Upload a square logo or mark. Scout applies it to shared reports and notification emails.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Default environment" type="string" required>
Decide which environment (production, staging, preview) Scout selects when teammates launch a new exploration.
</ResponseField>

## Roles and access

<Expandable title="Roles">
  <ResponseField name="Owner" type="role">
    Full administrative access. Owners manage billing, integrations, and workspace defaults.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="Maintainer" type="role">
    Can launch explorations, adjust personas, and triage findings.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="Viewer" type="role">
    Read-only access to insights—great for stakeholders who just need the intel.
  </ResponseField>
</Expandable>

<Info>
  Invite collaborators with their work email. Each invitation includes links to recent runs so new teammates can understand how Scout explores your product.
</Info>

## Notifications

<ResponseField name="Digest" type="schedule">
Receive a daily or weekly summary of new findings and resolved issues.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Real-time" type="channel[]">
Select where immediate alerts go—email, Slack, Teams, or webhooks. Each channel can be filtered by severity so only critical findings interrupt your flow.
</ResponseField>

## Billing and usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a plan">
    Choose month-to-month for prototypes or annual for production teams. Plans include a baseline number of exploration hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track consumption">
    The usage dashboard highlights how many hours each environment consumed. Schedule insights help prevent surprise overages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage add-ons">
    Purchase extra exploration hours or reserved automation runs as your coverage expands.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

- Keep a single workspace per product so histories stay focused.
- Use descriptive environment names ("Production – US" instead of just "Prod").
- Review access quarterly to ensure only active collaborators can launch explorations.
