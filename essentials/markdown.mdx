Every exploration ends with a field report that captures what Scout saw, what broke, and what to do next. The report format is designed to keep vibe coding teams moving without sacrificing quality.

## Anatomy of a finding

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Signal summary" icon="circle-info">
    High-level description of the issue, tagged with severity and persona. Use this to triage at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reproduction trail" icon="shoe-prints">
    Ordered steps with timestamps, console logs, and screenshots so anyone can replay the journey.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Impact analysis" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Scout explains who is affected, what the user experience feels like, and why it matters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Suggested fix" icon="lightbulb">
    Recommendations for remediation or follow-up explorations to confirm the fix.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Working the queue

<Steps>
  <Step title="Triaging">
    Filter findings by severity or persona. Assign owners directly within the report to keep accountability clear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Digging deeper">
    Expand any step to inspect screenshots, console logs, or captured network calls. Export artifacts when you need to share with external teams.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Closing the loop">
    Mark issues as resolved and optionally schedule a regression exploration to confirm the fix stays fixed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Collaborating with your team

- **Comments** – Start discussions inline on any step to capture hypotheses and status updates.
- **Mentions** – Notify teammates via Slack or email by mentioning them in the thread.
- **Labels** – Group findings by epic, release, or risk category for easier reporting.

## From insight to automation

Each field report stores structured metadata (persona, environment, reproduction steps). Use the "Promote to automation" action to queue the finding for a future scripted regression.

<Note>
