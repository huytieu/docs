# Scout Docs

This repository powers the Scout by Katalon documentation site. It started from the Mintlify starter kit and now tells the story of Scout—the quality companion built for vibe coding teams.

## Getting started

The site is built with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com). To work on the docs locally:

1. Install the Mintlify CLI (requires Node.js 19+):
   ```bash
   npm i -g mint
   ```
2. From the repository root, run the development server:
   ```bash
   mint dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to preview changes in real time.

## Contributing content

- `index.mdx` introduces Scout and links to the rest of the guides.
- `quickstart.mdx` walks through launching a first exploration.
- `tooling/` outlines upcoming CLI and MCP interfaces.
- `api-reference/` captures the planned public API.

When updating or adding content, keep the tone consistent with Scout’s positioning: supportive, fast-moving, and focused on actionable quality insights.
