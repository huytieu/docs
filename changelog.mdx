## Multi-Project Workspace & Agent Improvements

A major release focused on organization and flexibility. Scout now supports multiple project workspaces, enhanced onboarding, and more powerful agent configuration options.

### What's New

**Multi-Project Workspace**
Organize your testing with dedicated project workspaces that keep everything connected. Create projects, switch between them seamlessly, and let Scout automatically populate project details from your URLs. Each project gets its own dashboard with test insights and quick access to create new executions.

**Enhanced Test Execution Management**
Search executions by URL, filter by status (completed, running, queued, failed, canceled), and rerun any execution with a single click. Share public execution results via `/t/{executionId}` links and enjoy a revamped execution details page with improved layout and information display.

**Guided Onboarding Experience**
New users now get a smooth two-step onboarding flow that walks them through creating their first project. Simply enter a URL, and Scout fetches metadata to auto-populate project names and logos. Enhanced sign-in with magic link email authentication and Google OAuth support.

### Improvements

**Project Management**
- Project switcher in navigation for quick context switching
- Project dashboard with test insights and execution history
- Project settings page for editing and deletion
- Automatic website metadata fetching for project setup
- Website metadata scraper endpoint (`/api/v1/meta`) for fetching titles, descriptions, and favicons

**Authentication & Access**
- Magic link email authentication
- Google OAuth integration
- API key authentication support for programmatic access

**Agent & Automation**
- Real-time streaming API for agent responses
- Chrome DevTools MCP integration updated to v0.9.0
- Refactored agent streaming architecture with `startAgentStream`

**UI Polish**
- Improved color contrast and theming throughout the interface
- Fixed button alignments and layout issues
- Better URL normalization and validation
- Optimized frontend build process

### Under the Hood

- Introduced `@katalon-studio/scout-common` shared package for type definitions and schemas
- Benchmark result caching during synchronization
- Enhanced agent streaming architecture for better performance

## Smarter Testing & Smoother Experience

We've been busy making Scout more intelligent and delightful to use. This release brings enhanced AI capabilities, mobile support, and a bunch of quality-of-life improvements.

### What's New

**Mobile-Ready Execution Page**
Monitor your testing sessions from anywhere! The execution page now adapts beautifully to mobile devices, so you can keep tabs on Scout's progress whether you're at your desk or on the go.

**Shared Context Intelligence**
Scout just got smarter. We've evolved our memory system to use shared context bundles, enabling Scout to generate more coherent and contextual test reports by understanding relationships across your entire testing session.

**Dynamic Browser Management**
Scout now intelligently manages browser resources, launching and cleaning up browser sessions on-demand for better performance and lower resource usage.

### Improvements

**Cleaner, More Readable Reports**
We've refined the structured report design with improved font contrast and removed redundant execution metadata, making it easier to scan and understand your test results at a glance.

**Enhanced Email Experience**
Updated our magic link email template with engaging "vibe testing" branding and clearer security messagingâ€”because even authentication emails should spark joy.

**Full AI Transparency**
Ever wondered what parameters Scout is using? The webapp now displays tool call parameters, giving you complete visibility into how our AI agent makes decisions during exploration.

**Polished Theming**
Refreshed our UI theming standards for a more consistent and cohesive visual experience throughout the application.

### Under the Hood

- Optimized report generation with a dedicated AI model for higher quality structured reports
- Fixed structured report streaming for smoother real-time updates
- Resolved flashing LiveView issues during sub-agent executions
- Added TTL support for CDP connections and live view URLs to automatically clean up stale sessions
- Updated to latest better-auth package with security improvements
