<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - An active Scout workspace at [scoutqa.ai](https://scoutqa.ai)
  - Access to the environments you want Scout to explore
  - Optional: credentials or seed data for gated flows
</Info>

Scout does the heavy lifting, but a few minutes of setup ensures every exploration delivers high-signal feedback. Use this page as your checklist before launching recurring runs.

## Connect environments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add environments">
    Create entries for production, staging, and ephemeral preview URLs. Label each environment so personas know what level of risk-taking is appropriate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store access details">
    Provide login credentials, session cookies, or seed data. Scout handles them securely for the duration of the run and discards them immediately afterward.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share build context">
    Drop links to pull requests, design docs, or release notes. This context helps Scout focus on the parts of the product that just changed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tune exploration settings

- **Personas** – Map personas to environments. For instance, pair a curious newcomer with production and a boundary-pushing adversary with staging.
- **Risk appetite** – Decide how aggressively Scout should poke around destructive actions, such as deleting data or triggering payments.
- **Session duration** – Longer sessions explore deeper paths; shorter ones act as quick smoke tests after each deploy.

## Collect richer evidence

Use the options panel before launching an exploration to capture the level of evidence your team expects:

- Enable screen capture for step-by-step visuals.
- Request console logs or network traces when debugging flaky flows.
- Ask Scout to propose follow-up steps you can convert into automated checks.

## Keep your feedback loop tight

Schedule recurring explorations for the flows that matter most. Daily or pre-release runs help vibe coding teams keep pace with production stability.

<Note>
  Rolling out Scout to a larger organization? Start with one flagship flow, build trust in the findings, then expand coverage to additional personas and environments.
