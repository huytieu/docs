## Overview

Scout makes it incredibly easy to start exploring your web applications. No complex setup, no configuration filesâ€”just a simple URL pattern and you're ready to go.

## Scout URL Format

Scout uses a simple URL pattern to explore your applications:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lovable Apps" icon="heart">
    **Original URL**: `yourapp.lovable.app`

    **Scout URL**: `yourapp.lovable.scoutqa.app`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Replit Apps" icon="code">
    **Original URL**: `yourapp.replit.app`

    **Scout URL**: `yourapp.replit.scoutqa.app`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Simply replace your app's domain with the Scout-enabled version to enable automated exploration.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify your app URL">
    Find your application's current URL (e.g., `myproject.lovable.app` or `myrepl.replit.app`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transform to Scout URL">
    Replace the domain with the Scout-enabled version:
    - Lovable: Add `.scoutqa` before `.app`
    - Replit: Add `.scoutqa` before `.app`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access with Scout">
    Visit the Scout URL in your browser or use it in your CI/CD pipeline to start automated exploration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review findings">
    Scout will explore your application and provide detailed reports with issues, screenshots, and reproduction steps
  </Step>
</Steps>
